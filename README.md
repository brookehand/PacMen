PacMen Factory Exercise 

In this exercise, I created an on-demand (via click of the mouse) PacMen feature. When a user clicks "Add PacMen," a PacMen will appear on the screen. Then when the user clicks "Start Game," the PacMen will start moving around the screen at random velocity.

To view: Download/copy the HTML, JS, and CSS files in this repository to a local folder. Open index.html and you will see:

Future Improvements:
- I will be includeing a maze for the PacMen to travel through and the "pelletts" that the PacMen eat.
